# A Tezos Grafana Data Source Plugin (and Dashboard)

![Alt text](/screenshot.png?raw=true 'Grafana Tezos Plugin Dashboard')

## Steps to install

For the time being it is not possible to download the plugin directly from the Grafana marketplace. We are working toward making that possible

As an alternative you can follow this procedure from grafana https://grafana.com/docs/plugins/installation/#installing-plugins-manually

Or follow these steps

- clone this repository
- create a new folder named `tezos` into your grafana plugin folder (/var/lib/grafana/plugins by default)
- Copy the content of the `dist` folder in this new directory
